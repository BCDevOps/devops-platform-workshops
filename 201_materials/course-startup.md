## Starting A New Course

Starting a new course will require the Mentor and the Event Coordinator to work closely together. Some of the things that the
two of them will need to take into account are:

- what is the date for the course
  - will there be enough mentorship availablity during the course? 
  > a mentor should be able to provide atleast __an introductory lesson__, __one follow up lesson for questions__, and a __closing lesson__. 
  in total this should take about 3 hours of time. They should also be avilable to support the course within the working communication channel
  at reasonable times. 
- how many students can the course support for that timeframe and given mentor availability
- is the cluster able to support the given amount of students and their workloads
- will the mentor have time after the course to support any needed changes to the course (ideally they should have atleast 2 to 4 hrs
to improve the course)

## Finding a Starting Date

The Mentor and Event Coordinator should find a timeframe that gives students 10 working days on the lab.
There will be automation to teardown Openshift namespaces in 10 days anyhow. 

The Mentor should be able to dedicate working hours to support the course. This should include online lessons/lectures/support
for approxamately an hr 3-4 times during the session. 

## After finding a Start Date

The Event Coordinator should create blocks in the Mentor's calendar for scheduled follow ups and course dates so they don't
forget. They should also add reminders to remind the mentor about advertising the course survery. 

## Creating the Event

The Mentor should ensure the Event Coordinator creates the event with a __custom event field__ for a __Github ID__ 
> Please ensure to emphasize that the Github ID is very case sensitive. 

## After Ticket Sales End

The Event Coordinator should pass a list off of ticket holders and their __Github ID's__ to the Mentor

## Provision the Course Startup

The Mentor should have everything they need to provision the workshop
