## How to Use

This handbook is designed for a group of one or more mentors to facilitate the Openshift 201 training program. This training program is __do it yourself__ style which guides
students through online labs/notes/slides in a structured way.

## Special Considerations

- with the 201 course, all students should have a strong enough technical ability to work through the labs
- the lab leverages many external resources (helm charts etc) and so it is a good idea to periodically test the labs your self to ensure they are working correctly.
- the state of the lab should be kept track of in github. This should be the single source of truth for knowing where students are in the lab. 
- No strategy  has been made on how to facilitate courses in parallel but in theory it should be  _fairly easy_ to administer multiple instances of the openshift 201 in parallel.
