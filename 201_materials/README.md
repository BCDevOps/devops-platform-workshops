## Who is this guide for?

This guide is meant for anyone delivering/mentoring the Openshift 201 course. It can also be used as a reference by anyone
interested in the delivery of this course. 

## Course Summary (from the Mentors/Governance POV)

## Course Setup

### Working with Event Coordinators
> Getting Dates and Calendar information in order

### Event Information Handoff 
> Eventbrite Events will have information on github ids which the course mentor will need in order to provision the workshop


### Provisioning a Course

Create a new Github Issue using the `new-201-course` issue template.

### Tearing Down a Course

This process will be manual. There are __ansible__ [scripts that can tear down namespaces](provisioning_tools/201-labs/README.md)

### Incase Things Go Wrong

You will have to troubleshoot at this stage since no part of the course is fully automated.

## Delivery Expectations and Scope of Work
> what can be expected from the course as well as the mentor (time/work involved).
