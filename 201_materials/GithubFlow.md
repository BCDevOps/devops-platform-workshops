## Github Flow
> ideally we should have a agent that can 'act' as a pipeline to simulate 'github deployments'

- make a repo
- make a branch
- make a readme
- commit & push
- make a pr and wait and for green deployment
- merge that pr
- notify any new branches need ot be rebased
- add notes on rebase --onto
- explain issues with manual merging and talk about how its a work in progress
