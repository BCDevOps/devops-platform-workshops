## Welcome to OCP 201 [date here]

This issue serves as the starting point in your Openshift 201 journey! It will contain,
helpful messages, as well as a persistant means of communication for reminding you on touch-points that
will be scheduled. 

## Course Length

The course will begin today and will end __two weeks__ from now [end date here]

## Touch Points

There will be 3 to 4 touch points for this workshop. Touch points are in-person meetings. The invite will be sent via email. These touch points can be expected to be between 1 and 2 hours in length. The schedule for these touch points are:

- Startup: A touch base on getting started. This will happen on the first day.
- 1st Touch point: This will happen midpoint of the first week. The room will be open to ask questions and reflect on things to learn.
- 2nd Touch point (optional): This would happen in the midpoint of the second week. The format will be similar to the 1st Touch point.
- Closing Meeting: A final touch base on the course. At this point facilitators will discover how the course went for you and feedback/improvements are collected. 

__Touch points__ are not fixed dates and will depend on student availability.
