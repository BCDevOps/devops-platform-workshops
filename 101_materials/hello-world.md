## Choosing A Good Repository Structure

There are several examples of different types of directory structures and patterns being used inside of the __bcgov__ Github organization. 


Checkout out some common patterns [here](https://github.com/bcgov/devhub-resources/blob/master/resources/community/finding-resources.md) and apply what works best for your stack and team.

There are still a few unknowns and best practices that are in development when it comes to repository strucuture - pros and cons to mono/poly stack repositories.

We look forward to hearing from you on insights when working with any of these patterns :)
