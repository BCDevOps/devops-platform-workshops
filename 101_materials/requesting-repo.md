## Requesting A Repository


All __BC Gov__ applications that run in our Openshift cluster can be found at https://github.com/bcgov. You will need to have a repository in this organization in order to be able to deploy in Openshift. 

Requests to provision respositories are made with __Platform Services__. This is done via github issue templates. Please check out [provisioning repositories](tbd) to start your repo provisioning request.
