# Overview
Welcome!

In these labs you will explore builds, deployments, as well as some common issues with storage provisioning.

These labs will focus on a single 2-tier application based on the popular open source chat utility, Rocket.Chat.

## Special Notes

The training is being delivered in a production Openshift Environment, using the BC Gov's 'Silver' cluster. 

You'll need an IDIR account to complete this course, so if you don't have one please contact your supervisor to arrange one before starting the course.

## Course Format

We offer this course in two modes, 'live training' or 'self-paced'. 

If you're attending the live training, we'll run through some background information in a 1-day workshop before the lab begins. 

For the self-paced training, you can view the slides and recordings of them being presented [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VNxqtRRECNd4uzZZslpLsdKYYXN70Gpu-jCLCD1yF9Y/edit?usp=sharinghere). 

The lab materials have been designed so that you generally follow the happy path for a simple two-tier deployment. There will be many intentional bugs along the way that will have you encounter real-life troubleshooting techniques.

__Please be aware the throughout the labs, you will be guided to make common mistakes, and then guide you on how to fix them.__

The live training has several live lab sessions scheduled for participants. These offer a chance to explore some additional topics, and to ask questions. 

### Lab channels

If you register for live training, a rocketchat channel will be created for your cohort. This can be found in the [channel directory](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/directory/channels) and the course are named in this format, based on the starting date `ocp101-YYYY-MM-DD`. 

For the self-paced training, please join the [#openshift-101-selfpaced](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/openshift-101-selfpaced) rocketchat channel. 

### Problems

This course has been newly redesigned and is constantly evolving with OpenShift updates and changes to the way we work within BC Gov. If you find a problem, or have suggestions please make an [issue](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-platform-workshops/issues/new/choose) on github.

## Who is this for?

While we love the idea of everyone getting their hands onto Openshift, the individuals that will get the most value out of the workshop are members that will be performing active development in Openshift. This includes Application Development as well as Operational Management. The course is technical, but does have step-by-step instructions and video guides. The course is open to anyone working with the platform. People with roles such as  product owners, data scientists, service designers and many others regularly complete this course.
