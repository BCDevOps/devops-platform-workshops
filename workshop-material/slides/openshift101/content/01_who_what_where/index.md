# Who, What, Where

Note:
We will focus on the three groups that support the Pathfinder Platform


---
#### (Who) are the people?
- Ministry development teams (ie. You!) / platform users
- Platform support teams
    - DevOps Platform Services (OCIO DevOps/BCDevExchange Branch prime, Arctiq support)
        - Clecio Varjao - DevOps Specialist, Todd Wilson - Director
        - Onboarding/project provisioning
        - Assistance and education of platform users
        - Improvements in platform usability
        - Education / hands-on knowledge transfer
        - Community Leadership        
    - Technical Platform Operations (DXC/ESIT prime, Arctiq support)
        - Dan Deane - Team Lead, Steven Barre, William Hutchison - Platform Admins
        - 24x7 operational support of the platform (DXC on-call team)

#### Pathfinder
- Ongoing OCIO initiative
- Testbeds for government to explore the potential of emerging technology solutions, and to capture the benefits. 
- Deliver business value through a 'learn by doing' process, matching known business problems with emerging technologies.
- Releasing leading edge solutions to production.
- What is learned is shared, so other projects have a path to follow, with a focus on corporate enablement.
- To facilitate speed and innovation, Pathfinder projects are provided greater latitude when adhering to existing standards 
- The learning gathered will inform any necessary standards/revisions going forward.

- Strong preference for Open Source development and frameworks.
- Select mainstream stacks that have upward momentum in Dev community

#### General Guidlines - Architecture and Technology
- Leverage platform-provided templates/components when possible
    - Already adapted for OpenShift
- Supported by RedHat (updates, patches, etc.)
- Security is to be considered at every stage of the application lifecycle
- Use 'cloud-native'/12factor architectures/principles (https://12factor.net/)
- Leverage/survey community for assistance/opinions on technology choices/approaches 
- Leverage platform's DevOps pipeline tooling
- Assume continual evolution/improvement of applications on platform
- Recognize shared aspect of platform - some level of uniformity required
- Design applications for resiliency/high availability
- Infrastructure and tooling should sit alongside code (e.g. DeploymentConfigs, BuildConfigs, Jenkinsfiles)
- Compose applications from re-usable components and share on GitHub

#### General Guidelines - Community & Communication
- Product Teams should aim for self-sufficiency WRT management of pipelines, definition of OCP assets, deployments, scaling, monitoring, etc.
    - Training, tutorials, books, are available to help with the learning curve
- Community (Internet, and Gov) are the support mechanisms - not individual DevOps Team resources
- Primary communication mechanism is RocketChat
    - Teams should  monitor (for alerts/notifications, etc.) and participate (answer questions, share findings, etc.)
    - Follow community conventions/etiquette WRT use of specific channels, appropriate @ mentions, DMs, etc.
    - [Chat-Channel-Conventions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Enablers-and-Events/Chat-Channel-Conventions)
- Technical team members should join and participate in DevOps Commons community - meetups, etc.
- Product Owner/Managers should join Product Manager commons
- Teams should share timelines of major milestones (e.g. first release, expected increased volume) ahead of time with PM Commons and platform team
