## Lab Content Style Guide

To ensure content development is consistent between all deliveries here are a few guidelines to follow. 

## Document Naming

All documents should be made up with `<order number>_snake_cased_title.md`.
This will allow the documents to be sorted accordingly and also visually queue developers of content what
order the content should be in. 

## Content

- Ideally we want the content to be as grammatically correct as possible. 
- Instructions should be clear and easy to understand. Minimize run-on sentences and walls of text
- Use images as a reference for beggining, mid, and end states of a set of instructions. 
- __DO NOT__ use images as a means for students to collect information to do their work.
> the problem with this is everyone's visual acuity is different. In addition the information in an image requires manual copy and paste via typing. This would be easier for students to just highlight copy/paste. 
- ensure your labs are tested e2e. 
  - I've found it easiest to write shell scripts that test instructions from the students perspective.
  - It is time consuming but will provide workshop confidence.
