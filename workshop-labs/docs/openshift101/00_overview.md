# Overview

In these labs you will explore builds and deployments within the context of the Azure Redhat OpenShift Training Cluster.
These labs will focus on a single 2-tier application based on the popular open source chat utility, Rocket.Chat.


## Special Notes

This training is being deliver in Openshift 4.3. The production Openshift cluster is currently in 3.11. 

### Why are you delivering training in a different version?

Platform Services is hard at work migrating the production cluster to 4.x. The anticipated deliver of this is late Summer with all teams being fully migrated to the 4.x cluster by the end of the new year. Providing the training in the a manner that is similar to the future production cluster will help old and new teams ready for that transition. 

### Will this still be relevant if i'm not developing products in OCP 4.3?

Yes! Besides the Openshift console, most of the commands that you run in OCP 3.11 are __the same__. 


__Please be aware the throughout the labs, you will be guided to make common mistakes, and then guide you on how to fix them.__
