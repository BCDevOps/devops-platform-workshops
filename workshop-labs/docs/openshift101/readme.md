# General OpenShift Components and Tasks

In these labs you will explore builds and deployments within the context of the Pathfinder OpenShift Platform.
These labs will focus on a single 2-tier application based on the popular open source chat utility, Rocket.Chat.

The content in the labs will get `slimmer` as labs progress. The goal here is that previous learnings will help
you familiarize yourself with the Web Console or CLI utilities.
