# Git Setup
In this lab, you will create your own fork of the https://github.com/bcdevops/devops-platform-workshops-labs repository, add a branch for your work, and create a draft PR for your feature work.

### Fork the lab repository
Navigate to the <https://github.com/bcdevops/devops-platform-workshops-labs> repository and click the "fork" button in the upper right corner.  Choose your personal account as the location to fork the repository to.

### Create your branch with the CLI
Clone the repository and create your branch locally

``` bash
git clone {URL to Repository}
cd devops-platform-workshops-labs
git branch [username]-201
git checkout [username]-201
```

Push your local branch to the upstream project

``` bash
git push --set-upstream origin [username]-201
```

### Create your branch with the GUI

Navigate to the public repository (<https://github.com/{admin}/devops-platform-workshops-labs)>

- Click "Branch:" and add your [username]-201 as the branch name.
- Click "Create branch: [username]-201"

Follow the above instructions to "Create your branch with the CLI" but exclude the `git branch` and `git push` commands to clone a local copy and switch to the already created [username]-201 branch

### Create a draft pull request
You won't be able to create a pull request until you have committed changes in your branch, so start off by creating a notes.md file and committing it to your branch:

``` bash
echo "# My personal notes message" >> notes.md
git add notes.md
git commit -m "add notes location"
git push
```

- In your browser, navigate to the "branches" tab

`quick tip: click on the "yours" link to filter out everyone else's branches`

- Click on the "New Pull Request" button beside your branch.

- Update the title and add a message (you can use Markdown, creativity is great!)

**IMPORTANT** Change the base repository to be {admin}/devops-platform-workshops-labs from the default of the parent (forked) repository.  (We don't need to go creating a bunch of PR's against the main repo just now)

We are not ready for a code review just yet, so let's make sure we open a draft pull request and not the default pull request that's ready for review.
